# CS251-Project-7
CS251 Project 7: Neural Networks and Handwriting Recognition
The goal of this project is to implement a neural network and use it to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST image dataset: your network will predict which numeric digit 0-9 is contained in test images that you present it. You will use radial basis functions (RBF) in the neural network hidden layer (RBF network).

The goals are to:

Explore and implement a neural network for image classification.
Gain experience with a real image dataset.
Gain experience with setting up a supervised learning problem and analyzing the results.
Revisit and review K-means clustering and linear regression.
Practice working with Gaussian distributions (i.e. radial basis functions).
