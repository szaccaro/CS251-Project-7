# CS251-Project-7
CS251 Project 7: Neural Networks and Handwriting Recognition

This was a project I did for CS251: Data Analysis and Visualization.

The goal of this project was to implement a neural network and use it to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST image dataset. In this project I explored and implemented a neural network for image classification, I Revisit and reviewed K-means clustering and linear regression which I had worked on in previous projects. This project also helped me  gain experience with a real image dataset, gain experience with setting up a supervised learning problem and analyzing the results, and practice working with radial basis functions.
