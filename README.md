# CS251-Project-7
CS251 Project 7: Neural Networks and Handwriting Recognition

This was a project I did for CS251: Data Analysis and Visualization.

The goal of this project was to implement a neural network and use it to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST image dataset. In this project I explored and implemented a neural network for image classification, I Revisit and reviewed K-means clustering and linear regression which I had worked on in previous projects. This project also helped me  gain experience with a real image dataset, gain experience with setting up a supervised learning problem and analyzing the results, and practice working with radial basis functions.

This Project included 3 files: rbf_net.py, rbf.ipynb, and kmeans.py

For each of these file I was able to get the correct test result.

for example when I plotted the given data I was supposed to get a jack-o-lantern and I got this:

The full testing of these files is in the rbf.ipynb file that is included in this repository.
